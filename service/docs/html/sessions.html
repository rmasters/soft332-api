<h1 id="sessions">Sessions</h1>
<p>The <strong>session</strong> resource handles the authentication of a user, which is required for some requests.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-method">Authentication method</h2>
<p>To authenticate with the API, you will need a pair of user credentials (username and password).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Send a POST request to <code>/session</code> with the username and password (see below).</li>
<li>You will receive a message to confirm it’s success, a 128 character token and the session information.</li>
<li>Store this token in your application, you will need to pass it to future requests by sending a HTTP header <code>X-Auth-Token: abcd...12f</code> with requests that require it.</li>
<li>You can use this token as long as the session is valid (which will be until it’s expiry date, included in the response from the POST to <code>/session</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sessions last approximately one week before the user must re-authenticate.</p>
